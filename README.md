# soil-classification
This is a machine learning project that aims to classify different types of soil based on various soil properties. The project uses a dataset of soil samples collected from various locations around the world.
## Data
The dataset contains the following features:

pH: the acidity or alkalinity of the soil <br>
Moisture: the amount of water in the soil <br>
Nitrogen: the amount of nitrogen in the soil <br>
Phosphorus: the amount of phosphorus in the soil <br> 
Potassium: the amount of potassium in the soil <br> 
Temperature: the temperature of the soil <br> 
Humidity: the humidity of the soil <br> 
Type: the type of soil (one of 7 possible classes)

## Model
The soil classification model is based on a neural network architecture that has been trained on the soil dataset. The model takes in the soil properties as inputs and outputs a probability distribution over the 7 possible soil types. The model is implemented in Python using the Keras library.

## Usage

To use this project, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

NumPy<br>
Pandas<br>
Keras<br>
Scikit-learn

Once you have installed these dependencies, you can run the soil_classifier.py script to train and evaluate the model. 

## Limitations
The model may not generalize well to soil samples from regions that are not represented in the dataset.<br>
The model assumes that the soil properties are independent of each other, which may not be true in practice.
